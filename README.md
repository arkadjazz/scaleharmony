# Scale Harmony
Scale Harmony is a Customer Success advisory focused on helping post-PMF B2B SaaS companies improve retention and expansion by designing Customer Success as a system — not a collection of tools or roles.

The practice is led by Arkady Zapesotsky, a customer growth operator with experience scaling global B2B SaaS, cybersecurity, and AI-first platforms, including work with Fortune 100 and large enterprise customers.
